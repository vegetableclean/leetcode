# project in college
* Win the second place in university project competition 2019
On the project, we aimed to make a robot that can trace a person by detecting their
face and also can doing the gender recognition. On my part, I focus on gender recognition
and figure out how to combin our robot with the hardware and software which we using
Jetson tx2 and fpga board DE1. By the project, I learn a lot on deep-learning and image
processing work and earn large interests on it.
